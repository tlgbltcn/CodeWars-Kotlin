[![CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/tolg/badges/large)](https://www.codewars.com/users/tolg "My Honor Badge")

This repository consists of some solutions to problems in Codewars via Kotlin.

The solutions in the repo are for reference only. Copying and using them does not benefit the developer. Note that, there are multiple ways to solve a problem and these solutions may not be the best solutions.

I think it's one of the best ways to learn a programming language and improve your skills.
